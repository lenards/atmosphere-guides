## Administration of User Requests

There are serveral types of requests a user can make while using Atmosphere:

- Resource Requests - These requests, when approved, will grant a larger quota and/or allocation for the requesting user.
- Imaging Requests - These requests, when approved, will create a *new* image from an *existing* instance that has already been properly configured.
