This will take you through the process of creating an image.

# About requesting an image
An image is a type of template for a virtual machine. You can launch an
instance and install the software and files you want to use, then request an
image of the instance using the Request Imaging from within Atmosphere, as
outlined below. This allows you to retain a complete copy of all of the
changes and updates you made to the instance so you can reuse it again later,
much like a template. 

**WARNING: <span style="color:red;">It is easy to include sensitive data in a public image.</span>**
