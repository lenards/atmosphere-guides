# Checking logs

The aggregate of all *Atmosphere* log output can be found at `<atmosphere_install_location/logs/atmosphere.log>`

Individual log files can be found in the same directory with a format of `atmosphere_<type>.log`. This includes:
- deploy 
- email 
- status 
- auth 
- API
- libcloud

*Troposphere* logs can be found at `<troposphere_install_location/logs/troposphere.log>`

Unlike Atmosphere logs, there is only one Troposphere log file. Here, you can see Troposphere authentication and API logs.
