# Requesting more resources

There are two forms of resources: **Allocation** and **Quota**. 

**Allocation** is a monthly allotment of time that we allow your virtual
machines to run. One of our allocation units (AU) is an hour per cpu of your
machine. A 1 cpu machine will consume 1AU for every hour it is active. A 16
cpu machine will consume 16AU per hour. Keep in mind that larger machines need
to be suspended often to conserve your AU budget. See [Calculating desired
AU](#calculate-au). Allocation is reset every month (it does not carry over).

**Quota** are constraints on resources that don't change on a monthly basis.
    
- maximum total cpus 
- maximum total volume storage (GB)
- maximum total memory (GB)
- maximum # of volumes
- maximum # of suspended instances 

You can request an increase of Allocation and Quota to the discretion of the
support staff. Motivate why the additonal resources are needed in the form
above.  

After you submit the form, support will get in touch with you about the status
of your request.
