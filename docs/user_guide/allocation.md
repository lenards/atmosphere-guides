# Requesting more resources

There are two forms of resources: **Allocation** and **Quota**. 

**Allocation** is a monthly allotment of time that we allow your virtual machines
to run. One of our allocation units (AU) is an hour per cpu of your machine. A
16 cpu machine will consume 16X what a 1 cpu machine would consume of your
total AU budget.
